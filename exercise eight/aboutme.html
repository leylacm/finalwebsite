            <center>Hi! I’m Leyla, and eighth grader from Seattle, Washington. I love Michael Jackson, The Twilight Zone, Bewitched (the TV show, not the Laufey album), volleyball, studying, making jewelry, drawing/sketching, The Office, and most importantly, Jesus Christ. Whether it’s playing volleyball with my school and club or drawing people and TV show posters in my sketchbook. In my free time, you can usually find me listening to lots of music (especially Michael Jackson), binge-watching The Twilight Zone or Bewitched, or on my phone doing my Duolingo or texting my cousins. I value my relationship with Jesus, trying my best, helping others, and not giving up. I am always eager to try new experiences and meet new people in my life.</center><br><br>

          <center>My family is a vibrant blend of personalities, cultures, and traditions that shape who I am. I have my mom (who works at Microsoft), my dad (who used to work at SEA-TAC and is now stays at home with us), and a twin sister. We share countless memories, from holiday gatherings filled with laughter to quiet evenings spent talking about our day. Each member of my family brings something unique to the table—my parents offer wisdom and guidance, while my sister keeps the atmosphere lively with her humor and energy.  I also have an extremely close relationship with my seven cousins; four of them live in Southern California. Despite this, all seven of us have shared memories together, such as Disney Cruises, Hawaiian trips, and watching "The Parent Trap" whenever all of us are in Seattle. Together, my family does many things: navigating challenges and celebrating milestones, we reinforce our bond by creating a strong foundation of support that I can always rely on.
          My friends are another essential part of my life, providing joy and companionship that complements my family connections. Whether we’re exploring new places, sharing hobbies, or simply enjoying each other's company, my friendships are filled with spontaneity and understanding. They encourage me to step out of my comfort zone and experience life to the fullest. Together, we create a tapestry of shared experiences, from late-night conversations to adventurous outings, each moment deepening our connection. With both family and friends by my side, I feel enriched and supported, ready to face whatever comes my way.</center><br><br>
